# INSTALLATION
This is a basic documentation as to how to install the <b>TRD 747-400</b><br><br>
  
To install this Add-On, one MUST have a <a href=https://www.flightgear.org/download><b>Minimum FG V.2020.3</b></a>, but the FG V.2020.4 is recommended<br><br>

<a href=https://codeload.github.com/Sadia2000/747-400/zip/refs/heads/master>Download Link</a> for the zip file.  
Extract the file like you would've done with any other Addon Aircraft.
Move the unpacked directory to your custom addon aircraft directory you've specified.

Rename the directory to <b>747-400</b>.
Make sure that the <b>747-400</b> directory does not contain another one (this can happen with WinRAR). If so, move the inner <b>747-400</b> directory outside.

To update, delete the <b>747-400</b> directory and install the latest version.
